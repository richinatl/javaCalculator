# JavaCalculator

### Description

The goal was to use Java to perform the task of a calculator. I really enjoyed this one, digging into the documentation on Java's built in Math package to create
the methods for trigonometry especially. So far in the early days of my Java journey I am liking it more and more. It has a lot of built in features and a huge variety
of functionality.

### Technologies

Java built on the Eclipse IDE
